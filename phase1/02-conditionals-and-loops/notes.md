ðŸŽ¯ Goal of Lesson 2

Learn how computers make decisions (if/else, switch)
and repeat actions (for, while, for...of)
â€” these are the two mental muscles behind all automation, logic checks, and API iteration.

ðŸ§  Step 1 â€” Understanding the Logic Layer

**_ The Brain of a Loop_**

1. Initialize i = 1
2. Check condition (i <= 10>)
3. If true -> run code block
4. Update i (i++)
5. Go back to step 2
6. Repeat until condition false
7. Exit Loop

**_Tools to control flow inside a Loop_**
Control | Meaning | Example
Break | Stop loop entirely | Stop when guest found
Continue| Skip current itiration | Skip guest name starting with N
return | Exit the function | Stop whole Process
