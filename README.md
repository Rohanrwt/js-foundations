# Js-foundations

This repository is part of my Problem Solving Journey, where I‚Äôm mastering JavaScript logic and fundamentals to build a strong foundation for software development. The goal is not just to code ‚Äî but to think, analyze, and solve like an engineer.

"**_Don't memorize syntax ‚Äî understand how to think through problems._**"

I‚Äôm focusing on the 20% concepts that give 80‚Äì100% real-world understanding, following the 80/20 learning rule.

**_Tech Stack_**

1. JavaScript (ES6+)
2. Node.js (for running code locally)
3. VS Code
4. GitHub for version control

üí¨ **_Notes_**
This project is part of my journey to become a problem-solving engineer, not just a programmer.
Every topic builds toward understanding how computers think and how data moves.
